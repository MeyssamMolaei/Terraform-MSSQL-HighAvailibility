# Terraform-MSSQL-HighAvailibility
This is a test project designed to demonstrate a complete ETL data transfer pipeline from a PostgreSQL server to an MSSQL high-availability cluster.
The project utilizes Git, Terraform, Docker, HAProxy, Airflow, and both PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server as key components.
The main objective is to simulate and validate the automated extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data using Apache Airflow, while provisioning and orchestrating the infrastructure through Terraform and Docker containers.
